  description: >-
    Event Management component is a messaging management component that is
    responsible for processing events as they happen from components. Processing
    of record of activities include modelling event messages, syntax validation
    and formatting of event messages and sending/receiving messages between
    components (consumer/producer). Event Management component supports
    different patterns of usage, including Event notification (subscription),
    Event-sourcing (representational state changes) and Event-carried state
    transfer (including data needed to perform further processing). Event
    Management component should include functionality providing a centralised
    CQRS queryStore for all components that implement event-sourcing with event
    carrier state transfer.
