spec:
  description: Event Management component is a messaging management component that
    is responsible for processing events as they happen from components. Processing
    of record of activities include modelling event messages, syntax validation and
    formatting of event messages and sending/receiving messages between components
    (consumer/producer). Event Management component supports different patterns of
    usage, including Event notification (subscription), Event-sourcing (representational
    state changes) and Event-carried state transfer (including data needed to perform
    further processing). Event Management component should include functionality providing
    a centralised CQRS queryStore for all components that implement event-sourcing
    with event carrier state transfer.
